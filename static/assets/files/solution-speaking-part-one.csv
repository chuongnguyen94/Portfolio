Do you think childhood is boring or adulthood is boring?,"<h5>Childhood or Adulthood: Which is Boring?</h5>

<p><b>WH-Questions and Suggestions:</b></p>
<p><b>Who</b> is more likely to feel bored - a child or an adult? Words and phrases: curiosity, capacity for wonder, responsibilities, job striking</p>
<p><b>What</b> are the activities that a child and an adult can do? Words and phrases: games, imagination, work, socializing</p>
<p><b>When</b> do children and adults experience the most boredom? Words and phrases: school hours, working hours, weekends, holidays</p>
<p><b>Where</b> do children and adults experience boredom? Words and phrases: home, school, workplace, social events</p>
<p><b>Why</b> do children and adults feel boredom? Words and phrases: lack of novelty, repetitive tasks, insufficient mental stimulation</p>

<p><b>Examples of Answers:</b></p>

<p>Adults are generally more likely to feel bored than children. Children, who naturally have a greater capacity for wonder and curiosity, are usually busy exploring the world around them. Meanwhile, adult responsibilities like maintaining a job can be mundane and monotonous, leading to more periods of boredom.</p>

<p>Independence can largely affect the boredom level. Children's activities are usually restricted to the safe boundaries set by adults, limiting their experiences and thus potentially leading to boredom. On the other hand, adults have more freedom to seek out novel experiences but may be limited by time, responsibilities, or simple lack of interest.</p>

<p>The feeling of boredom is not exclusive to a specific location for both children and adults. A child might feel bored in school due to repetitive lessons, just like an adult in a mundane work meeting. At home, both might experience boredom if they lack stimulating activities. However, this can be mitigated if they can engage in something they find interesting or challenging.</p>"

<p><b>Why</b> do you prefer one over the other? This could involve elements of social anxiety, crowd management, or the simplicity of interaction.</p>

<h5>Example Answers</h5>
<p>I deeply cherish the connections I form with individuals, and thus I am more comfortable spending time with just one friend. Our conversations are often more raw, personal, and meaningful. Additionally, I find that I am more energized after these meet-ups, whereas groups tend to drain me due to the need for more social management. Due to this, the quiet corners of cozy cafes are where I find the most solace.</p>

<p>Being an extrovert, I thrive in groups. Theyâ€™re exciting and dynamic, each person adding a unique flavor. Not only do I enjoy the camaraderie, but I also love the energy dynamics within the group. Iâ€™m intrigued by the collective problem-solving or brainstorming that happens, and I adore big, festive gatherings at larger, more spacious venues.</p>

<p>I relish the balance between intimacy and variety, so my preference fluctuates. When I crave deep conversations and emotional connection, I favor the company of one friend. However, if I'm in the mood for fun, exhilaration, and a lively atmosphere, a group rendezvous is my go-to. Therefore, both quiet, tranquil parks and louder, bustling restaurants are my favored locales.</p>"

<p><b>When</b> could time-based conditions hinder computer usage?</p>
<p>Suggestions: During power outages, in areas with limited or no internet connectivity, during systems' maintenance or upgrades.</p>

<h5>Example Answers</h5>
<p>One situation wherein it would be difficult for me to use a computer is if I were to have physical conditions such as limited hand mobility or severe arthritisâ€”which can impair typing and mouse useâ€”or vision impairment, which might prevent me from seeing the screen or text clearly. Thus, individuals with these conditions might require accessibility tools or devices to use a computer properly.</p>
<p>If I were in a location with harsh environmental conditions, like in the dessert with glaring sunlight or a heavy dust storm, using a computer would be tough. Bright light can cause glare on the screen, making it difficult to see, while dust can damage the computer hardware. Similarly, using a computer could be unfeasible in environments without reliable electricity source to power the device.</p>
<p>If it's during a power outage or in an area with limited or no internet connectivity, using a computer would be challenging. Computers rely on electricity, and many computer activities require internet. Moreover, using a computer during system maintenance or upgrades can be difficult or impossible if the operating system or software applications are temporarily unavailable.</p>"

<h5>Section 2: Sample Answers</h5>
<p>Without <strong>computers</strong>, my life would undergo several significant changes. I would have to rely on face-to-face conversations and physical letters for communication, which would slow down the pace of my personal and work communications considerably. Additionally, I would spend more time engaging in offline activities like reading books, playing sports, or going out with friends.</p>

<p>If I didn't have access to computers, it would heavily affect my daily routines. This is because I rely on my computer not only for work tasks due to its speed and efficiency but also for communication and entertainment. Also, without the instant information access provided by the internet, I would be dependent on newspapers, books, or people for information.</p>

<p>Without the computer, my communication methods would shift radically. I would have to revert back to writing letters, making phone calls, or having face-to-face interactions.

<p><strong>Who:</strong> owner of the item if known, authority figures.</p>
<p><strong>When:</strong> immediately, as soon as possible.</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong> nearby police station, the place where found it.</p>

<h5>Examples</h5>
<p>In the event I found an expensive looking piece of jewelry at the park, I would definitely report it to the police. While it's not known <strong>who</strong> the owner is, I consider it an ethical responsibility to try and help them recover their lost item. <strong>What</strong> compelled me to take this action was the possible value and sentimental attachment associated with the item. </p>

<p>If I were to stumble upon a lost wallet, I would take it to a nearby police station. <strong>Who</strong> the wallet belongs to is important as it contains personal information which must be protected. I would immediately take this action because the faster it's reported, the higher the chance of it being returned to the owner successfully. Not knowing <strong>where</strong> to take it would never be an issue, as finding a local authority to handle the situation should not be difficult.</p>

<p>If I were to discover a misplaced laptop in a coffee shop, <strong>when</strong> I would report it to the police would be as soon as it was apparent that its owner had left without it. The value of the item and the potential data that could be present on it makes it essential to try and return it to its owner. Given that <strong>what</strong> I have found probably has a high personal and financial value to someone, I would feel obligated to report it. </p>"
What will you do if you find something lost by others?,"<h5>WH-Questions and Suggestions in Phrases and Words</h5>

<p><b>Who</b> does the item belong to? : Seek any identification tags or labels.</p>
<p><b>What</b> can you do to return it? : Post it in lost and found groups on social media, take it to local police station.</p>
<p><b>When</b> and <b>where</b> did you find it? : Track back your steps, report immediately if found in your workplace or store.</p>
<p><b>Why</b> is it important to return it? : Value of the item, ethical duty.</p>

<h5>Examples Answered The Question</h5>

<p>If I found a lost item, the first thing I would do is to see if there's any way to determine <b>who</b> the item belongs to. If there's something like a tag or label that has contact information, I can simply reach out to the owner directly. I might also try to figure out <b>when</b> and <b>where</b> I found the item to see if that can help me find the owner.</p>

<p>For instance, if I found a wallet in the park, after determining there is no immediate contact information I would look into <b>what</b> I can do to return it. It could be posting about it in local lost and found groups on social media, or taking the wallet to the nearest police station. The more effort you put in, the more likely it is the wallet will end up back with its owner.</p>

<p>It is also important to consider <b>why</b> it's important to return lost items. Besides the practical reason (the owner likely wants it back), there's also the ethical duty. Someone else's loss shouldn't be our gain. This ethical stance is an important reason behind why we should always strive to return lost items.</p>"

When do you find it hard to allocate time?,"<h5>Section 1: WH-questions and Suggestions for Answering</h5>

<p><b>Who</b> around you demands a significant portion of your time? This could be family members, friends, coworkers or bosses.</p>
<p><b>How</b> does the task's complexity influence your ability to allocate time? Consider whether it's challenging to estimate how long a task would take or if the task's complexity requires you to allocate more time than you originally planned.</p>
<p><b>Why</b> does this hinder your ability to allocate time properly? Try to understand the underlying reasons, perhaps because the task is difficult or because you're not focused enough.</p>

<h5>Section 2: Examples of Answers to the Question</h5>

<p>I often find it hard to allocate time during my company's busiest season, which usually falls in the fourth quarter of the year. During this period, I have a lot of tasks to finish with strict deadlines, making it difficult for me to manage my time effectively. Not only are there many tasks, but they also tend to be more complicated, which complicates my time allocation.</p>

<p>One activity that makes time allocation challenging for me is my personal hobby of painting. It's a process that doesn't have a defined endpoint, so it's tough to allocate a specific time for it. I sometimes end up spending more time than I originally planned because I get so absorbed in it, which affects my time management for other tasks.</p>

<p>Allocating time becomes difficult for me when I have my family around, especially during the holiday seasons. Family time is unpredictable and can vary in length, making it hard for me to plan and allocate time for my tasks. Additionally, as much as I enjoy spending time with my family, I also need to balance it with my personal and work-related tasks, which can be quite a challenge.</p>"

<h5>Section 2: Pertinent Responses</h5>

<p>Perfume is typically sprayed on the neck and wrists because these are pulse points where the body naturally produces more heat. Increased body heat can help the perfume project further from your body and last longer. In addition, it's generally a good idea to spray perfume close to the body before you dress to prevent the perfume from leaving any residue or stains on your clothing.</p>

<p>It's generally best to spray perfume before you leave the house or before attending a special event. Applying it at these times allows the scent to settle into your skin and mix with your body oils to create a unique aroma. It's also important to be mindful of spraying perfume around other people to avoid potential allergies or sensitivities.</p>

<p>While spraying perfume directly onto your skin is the most common method, it's not the only place where perfume can be applied. For some, spraying perfume on clothing is preferred due to longer scent longevity, but it's important to consider the material and color of the clothing as darker fabrics might show residue and certain fabrics might potentially get damaged.</p>"

<h5>Section 2: Examples answering the question</h5>

<p><b>Example 1:</b> Paper books might disappear in the future due to the digital revolution. The accessibility and convenience offered by digital books cannot be matched by paper books. With the advent of smart devices, people can easily carry thousands of books in their pocket. This shift in reading habit could lead to the demise of paper books.</p>

<p><b>Example 2:</b> However, some believe that paper books will never disappear. Many readers still enjoy the tangible experience of flipping through pages and the smell of a new book. These sensory aspects cannot be replicated by digital books. Furthermore, those who grew up in the digital age value physical books as a way to disconnect from the constant stream of digital content.</p>

<p><b>Example 3:</b> Environmental concerns could possibly be a reason for the disappearance of paper books. The production of paper books contributes to deforestation and CO2 emissions. As society becomes more conscious about the environment, we could see a shift towards more sustainable forms of reading such as digital books. However, this will not happen until everyone has access to the necessary technology, which remains a challenge in numerous parts of the world.</p>

<p><b>Why</b> do you prefer your chosen format? (Reasons, benefits, experiences)</p>

<h5>Section 2: Examples of answer</h5>

<p>I am more of a traditional reader. There's something about the feel of a physical book in my hands that an e-book just can't replicate. I often find myself reading at home, curled up in my favourite armchair. Reading time for me is usually in the evenings when work is over and I can relax. It was my father who inspired my love for paper books, passing on his own collection to me. I find it more comfortable, satisfying, and genuinely pleasurable to read a paper book.</p>

<p>I greatly prefer e-books. The convenience of having my entire library in the palm of my hand is unrivaled. I'm always on the go and it's easy to take my reading with me wherever I am. My prime time to read is often in transit, whether on a plane or a subway. My preference for digital reading was influenced by my peers who are tech-savvy. I prefer e-books mainly because of their portability and the fact that they're more environmentally friendly.</p>

<p>I am drawn to both paper books and e-books, but for different reasons and situations. If I'm at home and looking to disconnect from screens, a good old-fashioned book is my preference. But if I'm traveling, or in a place where carrying a book isnâ€™t practical, e-books are a lifesaver. My college professors, who emphasized the importance of balancing technology and tradition, influenced my flexible approach to reading. Ultimately, convenience, practicality, and mood determine my choice.</p>"

Do you know anything about growing a plant?,"<h5>Section 1: WH-questions about Growing a Plant</h5>

<p>Suggestions: sunlight, water, soil, temperature, nutrients</p>

<p><b>When</b> is the best time to water a plant?</p>
<p>Suggestions: early morning, late evening, after rain, temperature</p>

<p><b>How</b> often should you fertilize your plants?</p>
<p>Suggestions: nutrient requirements, type of plant, type of fertilizer, season</p>

<p><b>Why</b> do plants need sunlight to grow?</p>
<p>Suggestions: photosynthesis, energy, growth, leaf development</p>
 
<h5>Section 2: Examples</h5>

<p><b>What are the basic needs of a plant?</b> The basic needs of a plant encompass sunlight, water, suitable soil, and appropriate temperature. Plants use sunlight for photosynthesis - the process of converting light energy into chemical energy for growth. Water, on the other hand, is necessary for the plant's hydration and nutrient transport. The plant also requires well-drained soil rich in essential nutrients and a suitable temperature range that favors its specific growth needs.</p>

<p><b>When is the best time to water a plant?</b> The ideal time to water most plants is in the early morning or late evening when temperatures are cooler. Watering at these times reduces evaporation ensuring that plants absorb more water. Itâ€™s also preferable to water plants after rainfall, as this is when they are most likely to be able to absorb the water well. However, variations may occur depending on the specific plant type and its water requirements.</p>

<p><b>How often should you fertilize your plants?</b> The frequency of fertilizing a plant largely depends on the plant's nutrient requirements, type of plant, type of fertilizer, and season. Certain plants need more nutrients than others, and thus, need to be fertilized more often. Itâ€™s essential to follow the recommended dosage stated on the fertilizer's package to prevent over-fertilization. Seasonal changes might also affect the plant's nutrient uptake, thus altering the fertilization schedule.</p>"
